A decentralized financial application built on Internet Computer Protocol blockchain where users can lend and borrow token to gain APY based on the so-called [compound interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp). The idea is the longer someone borrow your token, the more that you as the lender get interest back since compound interest is calculated based on the time ðŸ˜‰
