# LendLord

---

A decentralized financial application built on Internet Computer Protocol blockchain where users can lend and borrow token to gain APY based on the so-called [compound interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp).

## Tech Stack

* Blockchain $\rightarrow$ Internet Computer Protocol.
* Smart Contract $\rightarrow$ Motoko (ICP's native programming language).
* Frontend $\rightarrow$ React JS

## Production

### Frontend

Currently the frontend is only running in the local mode due to the update on ICP and the short period of deadline in between that update and the submission deadline. If it's LIVE, you can find it here:
